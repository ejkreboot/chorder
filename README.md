# Chorder

**Chorder* (a cousin to the [Slower](https://github.com/ejkreboot/Slower) app) is a simple piano 
keyboard for when you want to quickly play some notes put aren't near a piano. It is intended as a 
support tool for composition and transcription. 

Built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). Flutter is cross platform, and thus Slower is too. However, to date it has only been built on MacOS. Builds on Windows and Linux platforms still to come.
