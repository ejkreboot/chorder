support tool for composition and transcription. It also includes a media player with 
time warping to assist with learning and transcribing music, or playing back tracks.

Built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). Flutter is cross platform, and thus Slower is too. However, to date it has only been built on MacOS. Builds on Windows and Linux platforms still to come.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Pre-built binary

Download disk image from [the application web page](https://diatonic.org).

### üß™ Build from source (MacOS)

1. Install Flutter with macOS desktop support  
   [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

2. Clone the repo, build, and install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ejkreboot/diatonic.git
cd diatonic
chmod 755 scripts/macos_build.sh
./scripts/macos_build_ffmpeg_universal.sh
./scripts/macos_publish.sh build
```

For distribution (requires [downloaded Developer ID Application cert](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/certificates/create-developer-id-certificates/)):

```
export IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (XX9X9X9XX9)"
./scripts/macos_build_ffmpeg_universal.sh --sign
./scripts/macos_publish.sh build
./scripts/macos_publish.sh codesign 
./scripts/macos_publish.sh diskimage
./scripts/macos_publish.sh notarize
```


### üß™ Build from source (Other desktop environments)

Untested, but the following should come close to working, though some tweaking for ffmpeg 
building will be required.

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build [platform] --release
```

(Where `platform` is either `windows` or `linux`.)

The resulting binary should then be in `./build/[platform]/Build/Products/Release`
